    In an excel spreadsheet there is a single chart in on a table
    The chart is created using coordinates included in the table.
    There are 4 data series. The resulting plot is a rectangle where the points are scattered around the edges of the rectangle. Each series is scattered on one edge of the rectangle.

    The macro shall visualize the distance between the points by adding measurement extension lines from each point on an edge to its adjacent points on the same edge. 

    A second macro shall delete/hide the measurement extension lines from the chart.

        ✔ Exact position of a point in a chart @done(20-06-28 13:37)
       
        Use
        Tabelle1.ChartObjects(1).Chart. _
 SeriesCollection(2).Points(2).Left / Top
 To get the exact location (points) of all points within a series in relation to the chart area

 Use similar syntax(top/left) to determine the exact location of the chart on the worksheet

        ✔ Add an arrow @done(20-06-26 13:54)

        Selection.ShapeRange.Line.BeginArrowheadStyle = msoArrowheadTriangle
        Selection.ShapeRange.Line.EndArrowheadStyle = msoArrowheadTriangle
        ✔ Add an text box @done(20-06-28 13:37)

    Selection.ShapeRange(1).TextFrame2.TextRange.Characters.Text = "eiofjhioefj" & Chr(13) & ""

Coding:
    ✔ Get an arrow to point to the a point on the chart @done(20-06-26 14:49)
    ✔ Write a loop that iterates through each point in a series and draws the connectors between them @done(20-06-28 13:20)
    ☐ Add the text boxes
    ☐ Add formating
